<!-- document.write() delete all the existing elment of html
Using document.write() after an HTML document is loaded, will delete all existing HTML -->


<!-- it's important to be cautious when using document.write() after the HTML document is loaded, as it can remove existing content and 
potentially lead to unexpected results. It's generally recommended to use other methods to modify or 
add content dynamically without relying on document.write(). -->

<!-- The document.write() method should only be used for testing. -->
